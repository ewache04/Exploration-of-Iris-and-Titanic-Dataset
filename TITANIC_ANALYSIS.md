The RMS Titanic was a marvel of early 20th-century engineering, hailed as the largest and most luxurious passenger liner of its time. Built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast, the Titanic measured approximately 882 feet in length and featured a gross tonnage of 46,328. With its elegant interiors, grand staircase, first-class lounges, and cutting-edge technology for the era, it catered to both the wealthy elite and emigrants seeking a new life in America.

  - First-class fares ranged from £30 to £870 (approximately $3,000 to $100,000 today).

### **Departure, Destination, and Stops**
The Titanic set sail from Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912, bound for New York City. Along the way, it made stops at Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland, to pick up additional passengers. Tragically, the voyage was cut short when the Titanic struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic on April 14, 1912, sinking early the next morning and claiming over 1,500 lives.
